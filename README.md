This code is used to find a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on a given multiple sequence alignment.

v1: November 2nd, 2025
Currently able to find an HMM for a protein sequence, and generate "new" samples using the model

v2: November 3rd, 2025
Updated the code to:
  - Work for either a protein or nucleotide sequence
  - Included non-zero base-rate probabilities to combat overfitting
  - Better model deletions by including a deletion hidden state.
