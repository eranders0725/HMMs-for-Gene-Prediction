v1: November 2nd, 2025
If given a protein MSA can generate sample protein sequences that follow similar distributions

v2: November 3rd, 2025
Updated the code to:
  To work for either a protein or nucleotide sequence
  Included non-zero base-rate probabilities to combat overfitting
  Better model deletions by including a deletion hidden state.
